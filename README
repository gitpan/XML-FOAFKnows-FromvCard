XML-FOAFKnows-FromvCard version 0.3
===================================

This module takes a vCard string parses it using L<Text::vCard> and
attempts to make C<foaf:knows> records from it. It's scope is limited
to that, it is not intended to be a full vCard to RDF conversion
module, it just wants to make reasonable knows records of your
contacts.

It is also conservative in what it outputs. If a vCard contains a
"CONFIDENTIAL" class, it will write nothing, and unless a there is a
"PUBLIC" class, it will only output the SHA1-hashed mailbox, a nick if
it exists and a homepage if it exists. A discussion of these issues
will appear in this module later.

The module also contains a script foafvcard. With that, you can
produce a useful FOAF file from the command line with some
parameters. It will install itself to your system's directory for
executables and can be used directly after installation.

The script takes a vCard file as primary input, but can also take
other parameters:

--seeAlso=URI
	An URI to your, the author's FOAF file.

--uri=URI
	Your canonical URI, for example your own Person record.

--email=your@email.address
	Your email address, to be hashed and included as an Inverse
	Functional Property, to identify you as a person.


More information will appear here later.
