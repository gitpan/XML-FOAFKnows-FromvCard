XML-FOAFKnows-FromvCard version 0.2
=====================================

This module takes a vCard string parses it using L<Text::vCard> and
attempts to make C<foaf:knows> records from it. It's scope is limited
to that, it is not intended to be a full vCard to RDF conversion
module, it just wants to make reasonable knows records of your
contacts.

It is also conservative in what it outputs. If a vCard contains a
"CONFIDENTIAL" class, it will write nothing, and unless a there is a
"PUBLIC" class, it will only output the SHA1-hashed mailbox, a nick if
it exists and a homepage if it exists. A discussion of these issues
will appear in this module later.

The module also contains a script foafvcard.pl. With that, you can
produce a useful FOAF file from the command line with some
parameters. Have a look, more documentation will be added later.

More information will appear here later.
